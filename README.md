Survival
========

This is an ecosystem simulation made in python2 with pygame lib.
There are three types of species: Producers (Green), Herbivores(Blue) and Carnivores(White)

Animals lose energy as the time goes by. If energy reaches zero they die, if they have a lot of energy they procreate.
They have both Vision and Smell that can be observed using the Spacebar.




This is an area i'd like to explore. If anyone has an interesting project i'd be glad to help
